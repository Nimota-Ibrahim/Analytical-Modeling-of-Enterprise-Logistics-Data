# Analytical-Modeling-of-Enterprise-Logistics-Data

This project provides a **data-driven analysis of hotel revenue** using a dataset of 100,000+ records (2018–2020). By transforming raw data into interactive Power BI dashboards, the project uncovers critical revenue drivers, guest behavior patterns, and operational insights to support strategic decision-making.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic KPI Dashboard:** Tracks occupancy, RevPAR, and average length of stay.
- **Advanced DAX Modeling:** Custom measures for granular revenue tracking.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Behavioral and lead-time-based segmentation for predictive insights.
- **Multi-Dimensional Analysis:** Temporal, geospatial, and channel-specific revenue insights.
- **Operational Intelligence:** Analysis of ancillary revenue drivers for resource optimization.

## Data & Methodology
- **Data Preparation:** Combined multi-year datasets, cleaned and standardized columns, merged supplementary tables.
- **ETL & Transformation:** Engineered date tables and key features to enable robust analysis.
- **Visualization:** Interactive Power BI reports for revenue performance and booking trends.

## Insights
- Weekdays generate higher revenue than weekends, suggesting opportunities for targeted promotions.
- Early bookings contribute significantly to revenue but have higher cancellation rates, highlighting the need for tiered deposit policies.
- Couples are the most lucrative segment, indicating strategic loyalty program focus.
- Key markets, such as Portugal, show high revenue and ADR, guiding localized marketing efforts.
